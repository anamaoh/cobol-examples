Here is some simple COBOL source code, parsed with help of the [Koopa](https://github.com/anamaoh/koopa) parser for COBOL.
This repo contains two folders: src and build.
- The src folder contains the original COBOL source files.
- The build folder is home to Koopa's output files, which represent syntax trees in XML format.
